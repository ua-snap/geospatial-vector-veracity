This made it difficult when comparing statewide wildlife information gathered across the state. In 1982, a new standardized statewide, geographically-based, hierarchy system of coding was created called the Uniform Coding Unit or UCU system. Game management units (GMUs), Subunits, and uniform coding units (UCUs) are the underlying geographic foundation of the wildlife and habitat management and regulations for ADFG-DWC. The GMU/UCU system consists of five Regions which are divided into twenty-six (26) Game Management Units (GMUs). Many of the GMUs are divided into Subunits (e.g. GMU 15 has three (3) Subunits, 15A, 15B, and 15C). GMUs that are not divided into subunits have a "Z" designation for the subunit. GMUs and Subunits are further divided into Major Drainages, Minor Drainages and Specific Areas. The smallest of these areas (down to the "specific area") is referred to as a Uniform Coding Unit (UCU) and has a unique 10 character code associated with it. (NOTE: UCU layer is for internal and official use only, not for public use or distribution). The UCU code is used for geographically classifying harvest and management information. Data that cannot be tied to a specific code can be generalized to the next higher level of the hierarchy. For example:a location description that is within multiple "specific areas" within a "minor drainage" can be coded to the minor code with a "00" for the specific area. Unknown "minor drainages" can be coded to the "major drainage" level, etc. If the subunit is unknown or the area covers multiple subunits within a unit, the subunit can be specified as a "Z" code (e.g. an area within subunits 15A and 15B could be recorded as 15Z). If a geographic location covers multiple units or the unit is unknown, the most general code (statewide code) is recorded as 27Z-Z00. The original hardcopy master maps were drawn to portray the UCUs fairly accurately geographically, but were not necessarily precisely drawn (i.e. left vs. right bank of a river, or exact ridge line). Each UCU was represented by drawing boundaries on USGS 1:250,000 scale quadrangle maps with a thick magic marker. A list (database) of place-names and their corresponding UCU codes was created and is still used today to assign permit, harvest, and sealing information to one of these geographic areas. In 1988, the UCU boundaries were digitized (traced) from the original maps into a computerized Geographic Information System (ArcInfo). Minor changes were made in 1989. Effective July 1, 2006 - GMU 24 is now divided up into four subunit 24A, 24B, 24C, 24D. - GMU 21A and 21B - - boundary has been modified. Phase I2006-2008 - initial clean-up of boundaries for GMU 6, 9, 10, 12, 16, 19, 20, 25. These modifications have NOT been verified against the UCU master list or by area biologists. -ras Jan 2009 - Priority has shifted to getting the bulk of the updates into the master. Verification and modifications based on the UCU list and the AB corrections will come at a later date. This shift is to attempt to get the master into a permanent SDE GDB, set it up with the GDB topology, make additional clean-up/edits using the GDB tools, set up versioning, make it easier to replicate to area offices, and to take advantage of the tools/features available thru ArcGIS Server with versioned GDBs. June 2009 - initial clean-up of boundaries for Southeast (GMU 1-5), GMU 17, and GMU 18. These have NOT been verified against the UCU master list or by area biologists. -ras July 1 2009 - initial clean-up of boundaries for GMU 7 and 8. Also some adjustments for 25D based on the NHD 2008 version and ArcHydro Tools "raindrop" feature. These have NOT been verified against the UCU master list or by area biologists. -ras Sept 17, 2009 - initial clean-up of boundaries for GMU 13.

Phase II - Converting and establishing procedures for maintaining the master in an Enterprise GDB is underway. Effective July 1, 2010, Region II was split into Region 2 (GMU's 6, 7, 8, 14C, 15) and Region 4 (GMU's 9, 10, 11, 13, 14AB, 16, 17. This version was updated to reflect the change. An archive of the previous version (with Regions I, II, III, and V) is available on request as GMUMaster_063010. -ras2012-present - minor updates continue as needed and time allows, and as newer base maps are used.2014 minor updates continue as needed, including updates to domain listings (not affecting GIS geometry)Effective July 1, 2014- revision to GMU 18/19/21 boundary to clarify/correct previous insufficient boundary description. Passed during Spring 2014 Board of Game.</abstract><purpose>The Department of Fish and Game - Division of Wildlife Conservation's game management units and subunits are the most requested of the Division's GIS data. Hunting and trapping regulations and other wildlife management issues often refer geographically to the effected Game Management Unit (GMU). This file gives the user access to the currently available digital representation of the GMU/UCUs. The purpose of the GMU and associated Subunits and Uniform coding units is to give a uniform, geographic based coding system for all State of Alaska wildlife population and habitat management and regulations. This data can be used for mapping or analysis purposes assuming it is used with comparable data.</purpose><supplinf>The older versions of the Game Management Units, Subunits, Uniform Coding Units and any variations derived from these files can be used for display or mapping and but only to 1:250,000 or smaller scale.  Since the data was digitized from the original mylar 1:250,000 quadrangle maps with lines up to 1/8 in wide, the boundaries as contained in these files should be considered "fuzzy".  Boundaries are not to legal descriptions. 

July 2006 - GMU and subunit boundaries have been redigitized (heads-up) at 1:63,360 following the codified descriptions as best as possible.  These new boundaries are still under review and may be modified.

</attraccr></attracc><logic>The original Uniform Coding Unit (UCU) geographic documents consist of 1:250,000 USGS quadrangle mylar maps with the boundaries drawn with color-coded "magic-marker" pens. In 1988 these areas were digitized from the originals documents into ArcInfo to be used internally for displaying generalized harvest data.  Editing was limited to making sure areas matched the original 1:250,000 documents, that the polygons topologically closed, sliver polygons were eliminated, and the proper UCU code was assigned to each polygon. They were not checked to see if they match legal descriptions.  Many of the UCUs involving offshore islands where included in a single polygon for each UCU code.

Later revisions included reducing the ocean side water included in the UCUs but intersecting the 1989 standard 1:250,000 Alaska Coastline available from the Department of Natural Resources.  Additional revisions to UCU boundaries we made upon request and approval by the Division of Wildlife Conservation staff.

A project is underway to update the UCUs and GMUs to bring the GMU/Subunit boundaries to legal description quality (where available) on a 1:63,360 USGS quad map level.  A total reconstruction of the Game Management Unit digital files will take place without changing any of the actual content. This will be done to 1) take advantage of a more detailed coastline (ADNR's 1:63,360 coastline; circa 1998), 2) take advantage of the 3-mile limit (ADF&amp;G-DCF "Alaska 3 Nautical Mile Boundary"; circa 1999) , 3) update Subunit boundaries to their legal descriptions where possible (heads-up digitizing using the available 1:63,360  USGS DRGs), 4) improve the accessibility of the data layers.

Arc data was digitized from mylar 1:250,000 USGS base maps with the area delineated using (1/8") magic marker pens.  Verification of the data consisted of paper plots checked against the original mylar maps, and visually checking the logic of the hierarchy system. Problems with line and polygon topology were resolved by comparing digital data to the place-name/UCU database and discussing solutions with area biologists as needed.  Coastline derived primarily from ADNR's 1:250,000 coastline (1989) with modifications to UCU boundaries as needed to group islands that were not available in the ADNR digital version. No accuracy assessment has been performed against legal descriptions or real world positions.

This made it difficult when comparing statewide wildlife information gathered across the state. In 1982, a new standardized statewide, geographically-based, hierarchy system of coding was created called the Uniform Coding Unit or UCU system. Game management units (GMUs), Subunits, and uniform coding units (UCUs) are the underlying geographic foundation of the wildlife and habitat management and regulations for ADFG-DWC. The GMU/UCU system consists of five Regions which are divided into twenty-six (26) Game Management Units (GMUs). Many of the GMUs are divided into Subunits (e.g. GMU 15 has three (3) Subunits, 15A, 15B, and 15C). GMUs that are not divided into subunits have a "Z" designation for the subunit. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P STYLE="margin:0 0 7 0;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;GMUs and Subunits are further divided into Major Drainages, Minor Drainages and Specific Areas. The smallest of these areas (down to the "specific area") is referred to as a Uniform Coding Unit (UCU) and has a unique 10 character code associated with it. (NOTE: UCU layer is for internal and official use only, not for public use or distribution). The UCU code is used for geographically classifying harvest and management information. Data that cannot be tied to a specific code can be generalized to the next higher level of the hierarchy. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P STYLE="margin:0 0 7 0;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For example:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;a location description that is within multiple "specific areas" within a "minor drainage" can be coded to the minor code with a "00" for the specific area. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Unknown "minor drainages" can be coded to the "major drainage" level, etc. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If the subunit is unknown or the area covers multiple subunits within a unit, the subunit can be specified as a "Z" code (e.g. an area within subunits 15A and 15B could be recorded as 15Z). &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If a geographic location covers multiple units or the unit is unknown, the most general code (statewide code) is recorded as 27Z-Z00. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P STYLE="margin:0 0 7 0;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The original hardcopy master maps were drawn to portray the UCUs fairly accurately geographically, but were not necessarily precisely drawn (i.e. left vs. right bank of a river, or exact ridge line). Each UCU was represented by drawing boundaries on USGS 1:250,000 scale quadrangle maps with a thick magic marker. A list (database) of place-names and their corresponding UCU codes was created and is still used today to assign permit, harvest, and sealing information to one of these geographic areas. In 1988, the UCU boundaries were digitized (traced) from the original maps into a computerized Geographic Information System (ArcInfo). Minor changes were made in 1989. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P STYLE="margin:0 0 7 0;"&gt;&lt;SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt"&gt;Phase I&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold;"&gt;2006-2008 &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;- initial clean-up of boundaries for GMU 6, 9, 10, 12, 16, 19, 20, 25.

This shift is to attempt to get the master into a permanent SDE GDB, set it up with the GDB topology, make additional clean-up/edits using the GDB tools, set up versioning, make it easier to replicate to area offices, and to take advantage of the tools/features available thru ArcGIS Server with versioned GDBs. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold;"&gt;June 2009 &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;- initial clean-up of boundaries for Southeast (GMU 1-5), GMU 17, and GMU 18.
