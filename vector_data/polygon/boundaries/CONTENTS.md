| `game_management_units/yt_gmzs/yt_game_management_zones.shp` | Outlines of Yukon Game Management Subzones. These only have numeric identifiers, they do not have a true name, so the `name` field is given by `zone-subzone`, e.g., 11-30 indicates Zone 11, Subzone 28. Sometimes the subzones are also called game management areas. Polygons have been cross-referenced with this [map](https://map-data.service.yukon.ca/GeoYukon/Administrative_Boundaries/Game_Management_Areas_250k/Game_Management_Areas_250k.shp.zip). These polygons span the Yukon with the exception of the National Parks.

The alphanumeric "name" of the watershed corresponds to the "subdrainage" which is the smallest level of the watershed provided in this dataset. The name of the parent watersheds (two levels up) are also provided. We've also retained the French names for each category. Note that these polygons do span some international or provincial borders. | [GeoYukon](https://open.yukon.ca/data/datasets/watersheds-1m-0) | 182 |
